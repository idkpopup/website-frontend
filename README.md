### polarcloud Website ###

Contained is the complete source for the https://polarcloud.consulting website.

To achieve a response design, the webstie was build using a bootstrap template, licenced for $14 from BOOTSTRAPMADE https://bootstrapmade.com/buy/?theme=BizPage&license=single.

The website was written with the help of Visual Studio Code. It runs in a docker container in AWS via Elastic Beanstalk. The service was written in ASP.NET Core 2.2 MVC. A considerable amount of customizations were made to the HTML, CSS and Javascript.

Feel free to use this project and it's code for ideas on how to build your own websites.
